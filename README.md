# Project_2

After learning the basics of coding at the start of my first year at university using Processing, I made a game to show off what I learnt. I made a simple sniper game where the aim is to hit as many smiley faces as you can in 60 seconds. In order to prevent spam shooting, the player has to reload the magazine every four shots. This was a fun project which first gave me an insight into code optimisation - carefully choosing what Processing would draw every screen refresh allowed the game to run more efficiently.
